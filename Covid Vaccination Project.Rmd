Description of Dataset: 
  1. What is the data source?
    We have two datasets, one is of COVID-19 vaccination progress throughout CA provided by the CDPH following vaccine doseage by zip code from 1/5/21 to about present 9/14/21, and the other is demographic info in CA across all counties. The code chunk below provides the range of dates for the vaccine progress dataset.  
  2. How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
distinct(covidvax, as_of_date, .keep_all = F)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
countydem <- read.csv("ca_county_demographics.csv")
covidvax <- read.csv("cov_vax_admin.csv")

```
