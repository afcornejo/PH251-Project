This data set will relate to our question if being a homeowner impacts vaccination rates per CA county. While not a perfect representation of SES of cases, this data set will help us elucidate if there is a trend via linear regression between the homeowner to renter rate as well as the vaccination rate per county.


```{r}
library(readr)
countydem <- read.csv("ca_county_demographics.csv")
covidvax <- read.csv("cov_vax_admin.csv")
```

```{r}
str(covidvax)
head(covidvax)
tail(covidvax)
```
The structure of the "cov_vax_admin" file is a data frame with 11 columns and 65,268 rows. The data frame contains integer, number, and character data types and contains a redacted column that is inaccessible.


```{r}
str(countydem)
