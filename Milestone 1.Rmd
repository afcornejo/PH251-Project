Project Selection:

Scenario 2- COVID-19 Vaccination Updates in CA

Meeting Planning:

We will have weekly to biweekly in-person meetings for our project depending on
the workload.
The group will meet on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays, where we will track progress.
Communication will be via Facebook and text and our meetings will be casual at
first, but will quickly transition to a business-only atmosphere.

Rules and Responsibilities:

Adrian Cornejo will submit Milestone work and Victor Guillera will be the point 
of contact between the group and the faculty for the course.

The best date to meet with a course facilitator will be:
Thursday, Sept. 30, 2021 during the time period 1-3pm.
